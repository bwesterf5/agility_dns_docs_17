       Weâ€™re going to make some basic tweaks.

-  Create a new DNS profile as shown in the following table. Keep the
       defaults if not noted in the table.


.. csv-table::
   :header: "Setting", "Value"

   "Name", "example.com_dns_profile"
   "Unhandled Query Action", "Drop"
   "Use BIND Server on Big-IP", "Disabled"
   "Logging", "Enabled"
   "Logging Profile", "example_dns_logging_profile"
   "AVR statistics Sample Rate", "Enabled, 1/1 queries sampled"
